# Estate Application

Estate is a platform designed to connect tenants and landlords, enabling users to browse available properties, manage their own rental listings, and send messages to property owners. The back-end application handles these interactions through a REST API, connecting with an existing front-end application.

This back-end solution is built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, providing authentication and security through **Spring Security**, and integrates with a **MySQL** database to store property and user data. It communicates with the provided **Angular front-end** to deliver a full-stack application for property rental management.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

-   **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)  
   https://nodejs.org/  
    To check if Node.js is already installed, run:  
    `node -v`
    
-   **Angular CLI** (version 14 or higher)  
    To install Angular CLI globally, run the following command:  
    `npm install -g @angular/cli`  
      
-   **MySQL** (for database setup)  	 	
	https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/  
    To check if MySQL is installed, run: 
    `mysql --version`
    
-   **Java 11 or 17** (required for running the backend)  
	https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html  
    To check if Java is installed, run:  
    `java -version`
    
-   **Maven** (for managing Java dependencies)  
	https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi  
    To check if Maven is installed, run:   
   ` mvn -v`

## Clone the Project from GitHub

Open your terminal or command prompt. Clone the GitHub repository of the project using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Erika-Belicova/estate`

Replace the username and repository-name with your GitHub username and the project name, respectively.

Navigate into the cloned project directory:

`cd repository-name`

You will see two main folders:

-   **estate-front-end** for the Angular front-end application  
-   **estate-back-end** for the Spring Boot back-end application

## Database Setup

Ensure that **MySQL** is installed and set up (as mentioned in the **Prerequisites** section).

### Start MySQL Server
Before running the back-end, ensure that MySQL is running on your machine. If MySQL is not already running, you can start it using the following command (on most systems):  
  
`sudo service mysql start`

Or, if you're using a local MySQL installation on Windows, make sure the MySQL service is running through the MySQL Workbench or command line.  
  
### Create the Database  
In MySQL, create a new database for your application. You can run the following command to create the database:  
  
`CREATE DATABASE estate;` 
  
### Create and Configure the .env File  
In order to connect the Spring Boot back-end with your MySQL database, you will need to create a .env file to store your MySQL credentials.

-   Navigate to the **estate-back-end** directory (where your **pom.xml** file is located).
-   Create a file named **.env** in this directory.  
      
In the **.env** file, add the following variables:  
  
` DATABASE_USERNAME=your_mysql_username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password` 

-   Replace **your_mysql_username** with your MySQL username (usually **root** if using default settings).
-   Replace **your_mysql_password** with your MySQL password.  

### Configure the Application to Connect to MySQL
You need to ensure that Spring Boot is connected to the database. This is done through the application properties file.
  
In your **estate-back-end/src/main/resources/application.properties**, make sure you have the correct database configuration. The Spring Boot application will read the database username and password from the **.env** file.  
  
The configuration should look like this:  
  
`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/estate?serverTimeZone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=${DATABASE_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`

-   Make sure the name estate matches the database you created earlier.
-   The **\${DATABASE_USERNAME}** and **\${DATABASE_PASSWORD}** values will be loaded from the **.env** file.  
      
### Initialize the Database with SQL Script 
Once the database is set up, run the SQL script to initialize the required tables. You can do this by navigating to the **estate-back-end/ressources/sql/** directory and running the following command:  
  

`mysql -u ${DATABASE_USERNAME} -p estate < path/to/script.sql`

This will create the necessary tables for the back-end to function correctly.  
  
----------

### Important Notes:
-   **MySQL Running:** MySQL must be running for the back-end to connect to the database. Otherwise the database will fail to connect.  
      
-   **Database Configuration:** The back-end will look for the database configuration in the .env file, so make sure that your MySQL credentials and database name are correctly set there.  
      
-   **.env File:** The **.env** file should be placed in the root directory of the **estate-back-end** folder, alongside the **pom.xml** file. Make sure the values in this file are correct before running the application.  

## Back-End Setup

### Generate and Set the JWT Secret Key

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and security. To enable this, you need to define a secret key in the **.env** file located in the **estate-back-end** directory. This key is used to sign and verify tokens, ensuring secure user authentication.
 
Add the following variable in the **.env** file:  
  
`JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key`

You can generate a 256-bit secret key for **JWT_SECRET_KEY** from a key generator like https://generate-random.org/encryption-key-generator.

### Install and Run the Back-End

Ensure that you have **Java** and **Maven** installed (as mentioned in the **Prerequisites** section).

Navigate to the **estate-back-end** folder:

`cd estate-back-end`

#### Install Back-End Dependencies  using Maven:

`mvn clean install`
  
#### Running the Back-End

Once the dependencies are installed, run the back-end Spring Boot application with:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

The back-end API will be available at http://localhost:3001.

## Front-end Setup

The front-end part of this project has been pre-configured, and you can run it alongside the back-end for a fully functional application.

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **Angular CLI** installed (as mentioned in the **Prerequisites** section).

#### Navigate into the front-end project directory:  
  
`cd estate-front-end`

#### Install front-end dependencies:  

`npm install`

#### Start the front-end application:  
  
`npm run start`

The Angular application will be available at http://localhost:4200.  
  
## Swagger Documentation

Once the back-end is running, you can access the API documentation at:

`http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui.html`

This Swagger UI will provide details on all the available API endpoints.

## Testing the Application

To test the application:

**Open your browser and go to:**  
  
http://localhost:4200

**You should see the front-end UI, which will interact with the back-end API running at** http://localhost:3001.

## Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries Used

#### Back-End:

-   **Java (11 or 17):** Programming language for back-end development.  

-   **Spring Boot:** Framework for building the back-end application.  

-   **Spring Security:** Handles authentication and authorization using JWT.  

-   **MySQL:** Relational database used to store application data.  

-   **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation tool for Java.  

-   **Swagger:** Provides API documentation for easy testing and reference.  
      
#### Front-End:

-   **Angular (14 or higher):** JavaScript framework for building the user interface.  
      
-   **Node.js (14 or higher):** Required for running Angular applications.  
      
-   **Angular CLI (14 or higher):** Command-line interface for managing the Angular project.

## Troubleshooting

1.  **Issue:** The back-end or front-end doesnâ€™t start.
  
	**Solution:** Ensure that all dependencies are installed. 			Run the following:

-   For back-end: `mvn clean install and mvn spring-boot:run`
    
-   For front-end: `npm install and npm run start`

2.  **Issue:** API endpoints are not responding.
    
	**Solution:** Check the browser console for any errors. Make sure that the back-end is running at **http://localhost:3001** and that the front-end is correctly pointing to the back-end API.
